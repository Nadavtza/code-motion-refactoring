# code-motion-refactoring
This project demonstrate the various code-motion transformations and algorithms we have studied throughout the semester.
We applied the transformations manually, on real code taken from an open-source project https://github.com/alwaqfi/jfreechart-1.0.10 .
we reviewed four issues: 
1) investigate how well the transformations may contribute to improving the design of exiting code, through any of the refactoring techniques mentioned in class.
2) compare the various algorithms to see where the strengths of a given algorithm help to overcome difficulties in refactoring caused by the weaknesses of the other algorithmsץ
3) identify limitations of the current algorithmsץ
4)propose new ways of using them for performing refactorings that were not mentioned in classץ
